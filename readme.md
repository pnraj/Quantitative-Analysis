# Transportation Cost Analysis and Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze transportation costs across various routes and carriers to identify opportunities for cost-saving and optimize overall transportation expenses. By leveraging quantitative analysis techniques and developing a cost model, the project seeks to compare the total cost of ownership for different transportation options. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance cost efficiency in logistics operations.

## Use Case
The primary use case of this project involves:

- Analyzing transportation costs across different routes and carriers.
- Identifying cost-saving opportunities.
- Developing a cost model for comparing total cost of ownership for various transportation options.
- Optimizing transportation expenses to improve overall cost efficiency in logistics operations.

## Data
The project utilizes three main tables:

1. **Routes**: Contains information about different transportation routes.
2. **Carriers**: Includes details about various transportation carriers.
3. **Cost**: Provides data on transportation costs associated with different routes and carriers.

## Project Components
The project includes:

- Excel-based analysis: Utilizing Excel spreadsheets to organize, visualize, and analyze transportation cost data.
- Python-based analysis: Implementing Python scripts to perform advanced data analysis, modeling, and optimization.

## Files Included
- **routes.xlsx**: Excel file containing data about transportation routes.
- **carriers.xlsx**: Excel file containing data about transportation carriers.
- **cost.xlsx**: Excel file containing data about transportation costs.
- **analysis.py**: Python script for advanced data analysis, modeling, and optimization.

## How to Use
1. Download the provided Excel files: routes.xlsx, carriers.xlsx, and cost.xlsx.
2. Execute the analysis.py script using Python to perform advanced data analysis, modeling, and optimization.
3. Refer to the output generated by the analysis script to identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize transportation expenses.
